# portfolio-site
This is my official portfolio site where I will be showcasing my work and the skills I am developing.
My goal is to create a site that gives the user the choice of deciding how they want to experience the site.
The user can choose between the classic clean layout or a fun edgy design that will showcase more advanced design skills.
This will be an ongoing project and over time I will hopefully be able to build on my skills and develop this into a fun
and interactive site.
